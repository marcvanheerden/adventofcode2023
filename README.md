These are not meant to be optimal (in any sense) solutions.
I am using this to practice some things and going with the solution I enjoy the most rather than trying to optimize performance or any other objective.

Aims:
- Practice async Rust
- Debug using telemetry
- Begin solving problems before input file is fully consumed where possible
